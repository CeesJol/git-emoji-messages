# Git Emoji Messages

Emojified commit messages can make commit messages, and thus GitHub repositories, more readable (and fancier!). This is a WIP guideline of how emojis could be used to prettify commit messages.

## Example

Here's an example to highlight the difference, of three commit messages, arranged from new to old.

Default commit messages:

```
Add feedback button
New home page design
Initialize project
```

Emojified commit messages:

```
✨ NEW: Add feedback button
💄 STYLE: New home page design
🎉 INIT: Initialize project
```

## Message types

### Common types

These default commit message types should cover most commit messages.

| Prefix       | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 🎉 INIT:     | Initialize a project.                      |
| ✨ NEW:      | Add a feature.                             |
| 🐛 FIX:      | Fix a bug.                                 |
| ⚙️ CHORE:    | Modification that doesn't impact the user. |
| 📝 DOC:      | Document something.                        |
| 👌 IMPROVE:  | Improve an existing feature.               |
| ♻️ REFACTOR: | Refactor parts of the code.                |

### Other types

These could be used for specific cases. A lot more that you can think of could be added.
